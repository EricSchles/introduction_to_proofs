Welcome to Higher mathematics
\tableofcontents
\chapter{Why We Prove Things}
In this chapter I explain why proving things can be useful and how to make use of it in your daily life, career and in the larger context of the universe of knowledge
\chapter{Understanding numbers}
In this chapter I give an introduction to numbers and how they came about.  Then I give some basic examples and exercises of properties of numbers.  
\chapter{A First Technique}
In this chapter I give an analysis of a first technique for proving things as well as a number of examples of how to use the technique.
\chapter{Adding To Our List Of Techniques}
In this chapter I present more techniques with similar analysis.  Here we will review the first technique and show how it can be used in conjunction with the other techniques we will learn.
\chapter{The Axiomatic Approach}
Here we will discuss some major axioms in mathematics. As well as the use of conventions and primitives.  This will inform a larger understanding of how thought works. And provide a way to look beneath the covers of logic.
\chapter{Towards A First Theory}
Here we will use our axioms to construct a theory of mathematics and then we will relate this theory to some tanglible examples.
\chapter{Expanding Our Theory}

\chapter{Exploring new roads}
